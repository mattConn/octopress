Iâ€™m a software developer with a BS in communications from The College of Staten Island, currently pursuing a BS in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science at the same college. Previously, I worked as a web developer for The Charles NYC.

I enjoy programming in C/C++, JavaScript, and more recently, Python and Julia.

This website serves mainly as a blog where I write about projects I've been working on and anything interesting I might discover during development.
